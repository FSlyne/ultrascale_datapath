This project is an example project for packaging an ip from an existing verilog function.

this project packages the burst mode preamble/delimiter sync function to an ip with AXIS interface.

inputs and outputs are converted to AXIS compatible interface.

a copy of the packaged IP is already available in ${topdir}/sources/ip_sources in order to recreate the IP

To recreate the IP pacakge, follow this step:
	
	-Open vivado project navigator
	-move to packaging project scripts directory in the TCL command window
		cd ${topdir}/sources/vavado_packging_srcs/BurstModeSyncIPpackagingProj/scripts/
	-run the projRecreate.tcl in the TCL command window
		source ./projRecreate.tcl
	
	
A copy of the newly generated IP will be there in the ${topdir}/sources/vavado_packging_srcs/BurstModeSyncIPpackagingProj/ip_repo/ directory
